<h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>
<p>Meetings are very important in the development process, they ensure that everybody
is on the same page and we can received feedback from our clients. But at the same
time meetings can become a painful process were the team feels that it's losing
valuable time.</p>
<h3 id="meeting-tips">Meeting tips</h3>
<p>Before digging in to the particular process that we use at talPor,
it would be useful to keep some tips in mind to transform meetings into a productive
tool and a competitive advantage:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start on time and finish on time</strong>. People appreciate it when you understand that
  their time is valuable. Another note on time: Do not schedule any meetings to last
  longer than an hour. Sixty minutes is generally the longest time workers can
  remain truly engaged.</li>
<li><strong>Stick to your schedule</strong>. Create an agenda that lays out everything you plan
  to cover in the meeting. Once you're in the meeting, put that agenda somewhere
  accessible for everyone (Trello is a great alternative) and guide the flow of
  the meeting according to the points that are reflected there. This keeps
  people focused.</li>
<li><strong>Identify who is responsible for leading each topic</strong>. Someone other than the
  formal meeting leader is often responsible for leading the discussion of a
  particular agenda item. This person may be providing context for the topic,
  explaining data, or may have organizational responsibility for that area.
  Identifying this person next to the agenda item ensures that anyone who is
  responsible for leading part of the agenda knows it -- and prepares for it
  -- before the meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Recap decisions and actions just before the meeting ends</strong>. For productive
  meetings, the end is just as important as the beginning. Don't let people leave
  the meeting in silent disagreement.</li>
<li><strong>Follow up</strong>. It's quite common for people to come away from the same meeting
  with very different interpretations of what went on. To reduce this risk, use
  Trello to highlight what was accomplished to all who attended, document the
  responsibilities given, tasks delegated, and any assigned deadlines.
  This way, everyone will be on the same page.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weekly-meetings">Weekly Meetings</h3>
<p>At talPor we use weekly meetings to keep track of the progress of each project.
Ideally these meetings happen every week, at the same day, at the same time and
are split into three meetings.</p>
<h4 id="pre-meeting">Pre-meeting</h4>
<p>This meeting is just for the development team, it usually happens
just before meeting with the client. The key objective here is to make sure that
the team is on the same page with the line of communication that is going to be
delivered to the client.  It's important that everyone is clear about what you
will and won't say as well as how things will be presented. Take time to prepare
strategies to confront possible problems or difficult situations that could arise
during the next meeting. Use the shared agenda with the client to make sure that
you can handle all the points reflected there. After the "Pre-meeting" the team
has to be able to explain the progress of the week, give feedback related to the
overall scope of the project and have a proposal of what is going to be the
focus of the next week.</p>
<h4 id="client-meeting">Client Meeting</h4>
<p>At this point the client joins the development team and the idea is to
answer the following questions</p>
<ul>
<li>What was last week's progress?</li>
<li>Did we fulfill the expectations the team had? If we didn't, explain why and
  how does that affects our schedule.</li>
<li>How are we in regards to our schedule?</li>
<li>Are we meeting any particular deadline established with the client?</li>
<li>Is there any change in the scope of the project?</li>
<li>What is going to be the expectation for the next week?</li>
</ul>
<p>This meeting is definitely key in the relationship with the clients, but it's
important to maintain constant communication with them over the week to show
any progress, because if we use this meeting to show new features the meeting
is going to take a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Slack</strong> is your best tool for constant and effective communication.</p>
<p>Keep the project's <strong>Trello</strong> board updated and do your best to
engage the client there to receive as much feedback as possible before the meeting.</p>
<h4 id="post-meeting">Post-meeting</h4>
<p>This happens immediately after the meeting with the client
and is just for the development team. The goal is to make sure that everyone
knows their respective responsibilities. Use this time to update Trello according
to the feedback received in the previous meeting.</p></div>
