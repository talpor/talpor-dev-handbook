## Definition of done

The Definition of done is a concept extracted from the Agile Scrum
methodology, and it's crucial to a highly functioning agile team. It's
defined as a set of criteria or checklist that should be met before a
feature (usually a task or a User Story) is considered **Done**. With
this in mind, everyone that is involved with the team will have a
common understanding of "what's done". It should be taken into account
that a feature should be considered done when it is a "potentially
shippable" feature or it's ready to be released.

Currently, we use the following criteria to specify if a feature is
done:

  1. The code for the featured was produced.
  2. Tests written and passing.
  3. The code is commited and pushed to the development repository.
  4. The code is live in the development server.
  5. Acceptance tests have been carried out by the client.
  6. Code is merged and pushed into Production environment.
  7. Code is live into production environment.



> Every task or feature must comply with the definition of done before
> consider it finished!
